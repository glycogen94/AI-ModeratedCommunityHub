## Original Requirements:
The project's objective is to establish a community site, reminiscent of platforms like Reddit or Stack Exchange, fortified by an AI-assisted content moderation system powered by the GPT-4 API. It's essential to note that we won't be training the AI ourselves; instead, we'll leverage the capabilities of the GPT API. By doing so, our platform will ensure users can share and engage in diverse discussions while maintaining an environment free from harmful content like sexist remarks, racist language, and profanities. The adaptive nature of this system, which continuously refines moderation policies based on AI-human feedback loops, positions our platform as a beacon of respect, safety, and meaningful discourse in the digital community realm.
