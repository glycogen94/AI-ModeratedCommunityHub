Purpose of the Project:

To design and launch a community site that integrates an AI-assisted content moderation system using GPT-4. This community site will:

Provide a platform for users to share, discuss, and engage with diverse content.
Incorporate a moderation system based on pre-defined policy guidelines to ensure that shared content aligns with community standards.
Filter out inappropriate content, specifically targeting sexist, racist language, and profanities, to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all users.
Iteratively refine content moderation policies by analyzing discrepancies between GPT-4's judgments and human evaluations to ensure the system evolves with the community's needs.
Utilize an iterative process to enhance the accuracy and precision of content moderation policies, enabling the community site to scale while preserving content quality.
Offer a solution that can be tailored to the specific needs and values of the community, with the flexibility for administrators or community leaders to adjust policies as required.
Ensure that all members of the community, irrespective of their background, feel safe and valued, fostering a sense of belonging and promoting healthy discussions.
The ultimate goal is to create a vibrant, inclusive, and self-regulating online community where users can interact freely, assured that the content they encounter adheres to the highest standards of respect and decency.
